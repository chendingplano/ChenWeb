1. Packages and Directories
---------------------------
  - Each sub-directory under server/api defines a package
  - Go prefers lowercase single-word package names

2. Package names
----------------
  - Any file that contains a func main() must use the package 'main'
  - Files in a directory that has main.go must all use the package 'main'

3. Working directory
--------------------
cd ~/Workspace/ChenWeb
go run server/cmd/dataservice/main.go

In the above example, the Go working directory is ~/Workspace/ChenWeb.

4. .env
-------
The .env is created in the Go root directory, or the directory in which
go.mod resides. In my environment, it is ~/Workspace/ChenWeb.

5. direnv
---------
After made some changes, say editted .envrc, you need to run:
  direnv allow /Users/cding/Workspace/ChenWeb/.envrc
